# Working
Scrapper was last tested on 10th April 2020, Any changes to the site will hamper its working

# Disclaimer
This scraper is provided as a public service because Glasdoor doesn't have an API for reviews. Glassdoor TOS prohibit scraping and I make no representation that your account won't be banned if you use this program. Furthermore, should I be contacted by Glassdoor with a request to remove this repo, I will do so immediately.

It takes about 1.5 seconds per review to scrape. So it will take about 25 minutes to scrape 1,000 reviews, or a little over 4 hours to scrape 10,000 reviews. This script requires patience. üòÅ

# Installation
First, make sure that you're using Python 3.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside this repo. Consider doing this inside of a Python virtual environment.
3. Install [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) in the working directory.
4. Create a `secret.json` file containing the keys `username` and `password` with your Glassdoor login information, or pass those arguments at the command line. Note that the second method is less secure, but in any case you should consider creating a dummy Glassdoor account.

                                              with --start_from_url. You also must have sorted
                                              Glassdoor reviews ASCENDING by date.
                                              
  --min_date MIN_DATE                         Earliest review date to scrape. Only use this option

```

Run the script as follows, taking Wells Fargo as an example. You can pass `--headless` to prevent the Chrome window from being visible, and the `--limit` option will limit how many reviews get scraped. The`-f` option specifies the output file, which defaults to `glassdoor_reviews.csv`.
